    Git project settings

    1. Open settings and make sure that git enabled is checked
    2. Then click on source control(middle one out of the left most 5 buttons). Then click on the initialize repository button, which asks for the folder that you want to push the code to.
    3. Then one has to undergo two processes commit and push. for first time, enter init and click the tick mark in the source control button.
    4.If we try to push the changes now, we get an error, as we still didn't sign into github. 
    So, a remote repository from github needs to be added, for which go to command pallete and search for git: add remote, where one can add the repository.
    5. For this, we need to authorize vscode on github, where a token is generated, hich on pasting it on vscode and on hitting enter, vscode get access to the repos that are on the github, where we can select to which repo the project needs to be uploaded 
    5.Give the name of the repository, and then create the repo on the github, copy the link and put it onto the vscode here.
    6.Then we will be able to commit and push the changes by hitting the cycle button on the bottom left corner of the vscode window.

    <!--How to avoid the restless act of saving, clicking the file and opening it in browser?
        To do this,
        1. install the live server extension on your vscode
        2. then you have a small Go Live button on your right bottom
         edge. Click on it.
        3. For even better experience, enable the auto save option 
        (auto save isn't recommended when javascript comes into 
        picture)in the vscode settings, which makes your life 
        a lot more easier-->

        <!--If Tag1 wraps tag2, tag1 is called the parent tag of tag2 and tag2 is called child tag of tag1-->

        <!--If a tag is opened, it must be closed properly within its scope(properly sandwiched)-->

        <!--What if we have a large paragraph, we have to scroll right and left, very tedious. A solution to this is turning on the word wrap on so that the tedious task of scrolling right and left would be avoided
        So, go and do that quickly, you'll thank me later:)-->

    <!--Heading Elements in HTML-->
    <h1>This is Heading 1</h1>
    <h2>This is Heading 2</h2>
    <h3>This is Heading 3</h3>
    <h4>This is Heading 4</h4>
    <h5>This is Heading 5</h5>
    <h6>This is Heading 6</h6>

    <!--We can wrap any tag inside another tag,for instance p tag can be wrapped with h1 tag, which is allowed to do so-->

    <!--Paragraph Tag in HTML-->
    <p>I know myself that this is not the firts time I'm not trying to build a website for the first time, but I still need to finish at least this time :-(</p>

    <!--Do you know that HTML ignores extra whitespaces(only 1 whitespace between words, though how extraspace you give) while getting parsed by the browser? This is known as whitespace collapsive nature-->

    <!--Sometimes, you need dummy text, like henever you know some content is going to fit into the webpage, but if u don't have it at that point of time, then this is going to be helpful. To get such, try to enter lorem, on which emmet pops up a suggestion, select it. then your dummy paragraph is ready. If you want to have control on no of words, enter lorem10(an example, for 10 words), then press Tab-->

    <!--Images in HTML-->

    <img src="./images/nature.jpg" alt="Beautiful View of Nature">
    <h3>Image of nature</h3>
    <img src="./images/nature.jp" alt="Beautiful View of Nature"><!--Wantedly done to demonstrate use of alt attribute of the img tag-->

    <!--src and alt are image's attributes; attributes describe the element
        1.src -> where the image is located
        ./nature.jpg, if nature is in same folder
        To step back to folder back, ../nature.jpg, use the both for going further, which generally isn't the case(Multiple path options of the image). Make sure that path is properly given.
        2. alt -> for some reason, assume the image isn't displayable on the browwser. then an alternative text is placed instead of the image.

        Note that we can even put  image address on the src attr of img tag to display an image of the web, but the path will be very long:(

        What about resizing the images?
        1. Resizing it on HTML using width and height attributes.
        2. Doing it by cropping wth an image editor before placing the image in project folder
        2nd method is recommended as the 1st one makes the loading time higher, thus losing the interest of the website users.

        Finally, in bigger projects, all the images are put into a specific images folder with each image having a proper name such as home, logo etc.
