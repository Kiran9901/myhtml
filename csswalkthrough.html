    <!-- Below piece of code written that demonstrates lines inside a style tag is said to be internal css.
    Now whereever the h2 tag is used, the properties mentioned below in the h2 selector are applicable to all h2 tags. -->

    <!-- External CSS, where the link tag is used to link an external stylesheet with current webpage 
    rel means the tpe of external file that one ants to link to. -->

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./css/styles.css">


    <!-- Internal CSS -->
    <!-- 
      <style>
      h1{
        color: indigo;

    <!--Inline CSS representation-->
    <h2 style="color: indigo; font-size: 1.75rem">
      This is an inline styling right within the h1 tag!
      <!--Inline CSS is fine for single property attributes, but what about the attributes that require multiple properties? 
     Assume that lots of h2 tags are being used and imagine the pain of writing inline styling for each and every tag! To avoid this, internal styling is used widely, where one can apply a property in common to all h2 tags in common.
     
     Remember that inline CSS is overrides the internal CSS, thats why still indigo color is on h2 tag 

     Internal CSS is only applied at the page level.
      
     Inline css is applied only at a particular attribute

     However, external CSS can be applied at the global level i.e, wherever one wants to apply the propeties mentioned in that particular external css file, on the head of the webpage, link the external css file to the webpage where one wwants to use. 
    
    Similarly, internal CSS overrides the external CSS-->
    
    <h1>This is h1 tag-1 with indigo color(Using internal CSS)</h1>
    <h1>This is h1 tag-2 with indigo color(Using internal CSS)</h1>
    <h1>This is h1 tag-3 with indigo color(Using internal CSS)</h1>
    <h1>This is h1 tag-4 with indigo color(Using internal CSS)</h1>
    
    <h2>This is h2 tag-1 with forestgreen color(Using internal CSS) </h2>
    <h2>This is h2 tag-2 with forestgreen color(Using internal CSS) </h2>
    <h2>This is h2 tag-3 with forestgreen color(Using internal CSS) </h2>
    <h2>This is h2 tag-4 with forestgreen color(Using internal CSS) </h2>
    <!-- Above piece of lines show how forestgreen color is applied in common to all h2 tags, as the h2 selector is mentioned in the style tag -->

    <!-- Now, here's the demonstration of how external CSS works below-->

    <h3>This is a h3 tag-1 with crimson color (Using external CSS)</h3>
    <h3>This is a h3 tag-2 with crimson color (Using external CSS)</h3>
    <h3>This is a h3 tag-3 with crimson color (Using external CSS)</h3>
    <h3>This is a h3 tag-4 with crimson color (Using external CSS)</h3>

  

  <h4>This is a h4 tag-1 with yellowgreen color(using group css selector)</h4>  
  <p>This is ap p tag-1 with yellowgreen color(using group css selector)</p>
  <h4>This is a h4 tag-2 with yellowgreen color(using group css selector)</h4>
  <p>This is a p tag-2 with yellowgreen color(using group css selector)</p>

  <h3 id="custom">This is a custom h2 tag, darkslategray in color, khaki background using the id attribute of HTML</h3>

  <p id="custom">This is a custom p tag, darkslategray in color, khaki background which has the same id as that of above tag using the id attribute of HTML</p>
  <!-- Notice above that though h3 selector is present, the id selector overrides all the attributes of the h3 selector mentioned above. And as both the ids of the h3 and p tags mentioned above are same, same properties(properties of the #custom selector) are applied to both the tags
  
  So, one point of conclusion that can be made out of this is that id should be unique to every attribute of the HTML, else the same would happen as happened in above exmaple. Good practice is to give unique names to id-->


  <!-- Defining colors of a rainbow using class and id while styling as a combo-->

  <h1>Version 1 of Rainbow(Works fine!)</h1>
  <div class="rainbow1">
    <p class="rainbow" id="violet">This is violet color in rainbow</p>
  <p class="rainbow" id="indigo">This is indigo color in rainbow</p>
  <p class="rainbow" id="blue">This is blue color in rainbow</p>
  <p class="rainbow" id="green">This is green color in rainbow</p>
  <p class="rainbow" id="yellow">This is yellow color in rainbow</p>
  <p class="rainbow" id="orange">This is orange color in rainbow</p>
  <p class="rainbow" id="red">This is red color in rainbow</p> 
  </div>


  <!-- Div element in html is used for assigning common properties to elements that one wants to group based on that properties. 
  Span element is used to highlight a small portions of HTML element by styling it (defining an id or a class for the corresponding span element)-->

  <!-- For above example of rainbow, an alternative approach is to use a div element, instead of mentioning class name as rainbow for each element of the rainbow group 
  Demonstration of the mentioned approach is shown below-->

   <h1>Version 2 of Rainbow</h1>

  <div class="rainbow2">
    <p id="violet">This is violet color in rainbow</p>
    <p id="indigo">This is indigo color in rainbow</p>
    <p id="blue">This is blue color in rainbow</p>
    <p id="green">This is green color in rainbow</p>
    <p id="yellow">This is yellow color in rainbow</p>
    <p id="orange">This is orange color in rainbow</p>
    <p id="red">This is red color in rainbow</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Notice the difference between two versions of the rainbow. In the first  version, the p tags are assigned class named rainbow and for each color, specific id's are alloted.
  As both class and id attributes are of the same p tag, the notation such as .rainbow#violet{...} worked to style each p tag.

  Whereas in the second case to grouping all the p tags ith a div tag, notice that the class attribute is assigned to the div tag,whereas the id attributes are assigned to p tags, which makes the styling not to work on the p tags in the second scenario 
-->

<!-- Now, following rainbow version demonstrates the use of span tag, used for grouped styling in general, but using it differently in this case, which can be inferred from the webpage-->

    <h1>Version 3 of Rainbow</h1>

    <div class="rainbow3">
      <p>This is <span id="violet">violet </span> color in rainbow</p>
    <p>This is <span id="indigo">indigo</span>  color in rainbow</p>
    <p>This is <span id="blue">blue</span> color in rainbow</p>
    <p>This is <span id="green">green</span> color in rainbow</p>
    <p>This is <span id="yellow">yellow</span>  color in rainbow</p>
    <p>This is <span id="orange">orange</span>  color in rainbow</p>
    <p>This is <span id="red">red</span>  color in rainbow</p>
  </div>

<h3>Don't worry! Go to styling file inside the project and find out yourself how to make those versions 2 & 3 work</h3>
