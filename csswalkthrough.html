    <!-- Below piece of code written that demonstrates lines inside a style tag is said to be internal css.
    Now whereever the h2 tag is used, the properties mentioned below in the h2 selector are applicable to all h2 tags. -->

    <!-- External CSS, where the link tag is used to link an external stylesheet with current webpage 
    rel means the tpe of external file that one ants to link to. -->

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./css/styles.css">


    <!-- Internal CSS -->
    <!-- 
      <style>
      h1{
        color: indigo;
        font-size: 2rem;
      }
      h2{
        color: forestgreen;
        font-size: 1.75rem;
      }

    <!--Inline CSS representation-->
    <h2 style="color: indigo; font-size: 1.75rem">
      This is an inline styling right within the h1 tag!
      <!--Inline CSS is fine for single property attributes, but what about the attributes that require multiple properties? 
     Assume that lots of h2 tags are being used and imagine the pain of writing inline styling for each and every tag! To avoid this, internal styling is used widely, where one can apply a property in common to all h2 tags in common.
     
     Remember that inline CSS is overrides the internal CSS, thats why still indigo color is on h2 tag 

     Internal CSS is only applied at the page level.
      
     Inline css is applied only at a particular attribute

     However, external CSS can be applied at the global level i.e, wherever one wants to apply the propeties mentioned in that particular external css file, on the head of the webpage, link the external css file to the webpage where one wwants to use. 
    
    Similarly, internal CSS overrides the external CSS-->
    
    <h1>This is h1 tag-1 with indigo color(Using internal CSS)</h1>
    <h1>This is h1 tag-2 with indigo color(Using internal CSS)</h1>
    <h1>This is h1 tag-3 with indigo color(Using internal CSS)</h1>
    <h1>This is h1 tag-4 with indigo color(Using internal CSS)</h1>
    
    <h2>This is h2 tag-1 with forestgreen color(Using internal CSS) </h2>
    <h2>This is h2 tag-2 with forestgreen color(Using internal CSS) </h2>
    <h2>This is h2 tag-3 with forestgreen color(Using internal CSS) </h2>
    <h2>This is h2 tag-4 with forestgreen color(Using internal CSS) </h2>
    <!-- Above piece of lines show how forestgreen color is applied in common to all h2 tags, as the h2 selector is mentioned in the style tag -->

    <!-- Now, here's the demonstration of how external CSS works below-->

    <h3>This is a h3 tag-1 with crimson color (Using external CSS)</h3>
    <h3>This is a h3 tag-2 with crimson color (Using external CSS)</h3>
    <h3>This is a h3 tag-3 with crimson color (Using external CSS)</h3>
    <h3>This is a h3 tag-4 with crimson color (Using external CSS)</h3>

  <h4>This is a h4 tag-1 with yellowgreen color(using group css selector)</h4>  
  <p>This is ap p tag-1 with yellowgreen color(using group css selector)</p>
  <h4>This is a h4 tag-2 with yellowgreen color(using group css selector)</h4>
  <p>This is a p tag-2 with yellowgreen color(using group css selector)</p>
